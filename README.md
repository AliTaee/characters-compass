# Characters Compass

## Objective

Create a Nuxt application that showcases two distinct overviews:

1. **Rick and Morty characters**
2. **Pokémon**

Each overview must be accessible via its respective page. Upon selecting an item from an overview, users will be redirected to a detail page. The look, feel, and navigation across the overviews and detail pages must be consistent. The only difference should be the data displayed depending on the content (Rick & Morty characters or Pokémon). Both APIs are already integrated into the project. If you want to add a third one, you can do so. You can look up the specs of both APIs.
