# Characters Compass

## Objective

Create a Nuxt application that showcases multi char universes:

1. **Rick and Morty characters**
2. **Pokémon**
3. **Elden Ring**

Each overview should be accessible through its dedicated page. When a user selects an item from an overview, they'll be directed to a detailed page for that item. The design, user experience, and navigation should remain consistent across all overview and detail pages. The only variation will be in the displayed data, which depends on the content (Rick & Morty characters, Elden Ring, or Pokémon). APIs are already integrated into the project. If desired, you may add a fourth API. You can refer to the API specifications for more information.
